The game concept is similar to "Pac-Man" and "Maze: Puzzle and Relaxing Game" due to the presence of mazes. However, each game 
has distinct objectives, mechanics, and narratives. In "Pac-Man," the goal is to eat pellets 
and avoid ghosts, while "Maze: Puzzle and Relaxing Game" focuses on guiding a white block to a 
designated point to progress to the next level. <br>
In "Glitch", the labyrinth will not be entirely visible like in the previously 
mentioned games; it will only be partially visible to spark curiosity among players 
about what lies in other rooms. To add intensity to the gameplay, players will 
have to overcome obstacles and enemies while searching for the exit in the labyrinth. 
These enemies can take various forms and appear unexpectedly to create challenging 
encounters. One example could be a love letter that is, in fact, one of the most powerful 
viruses. Only by solving puzzles and avoiding traps will players be able to advance to the next level.
